Manifesting the course work from Dr. Angela Yu's 'The Complete Web Development Bootcamp'
# cv
Interesting how I just saw an extra #cv as the title, or was that the repository name?

## Progress so far
I started Angela's course, and it is very dynamic and enjoyable. December seems to have gotten away from me, so I may have 5% or the course finished.

# Intention
I want to continue the course: I have to find the time.

The hourglass will treat me well. I would like to get a white board to mark what my hour(glass) is for.
